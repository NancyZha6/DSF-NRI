## Current Efforts 

## Findings

## Future Work
We have broken up our future on a week by week basis in order to keep ourselves accountable and have concrete deadlines for ourselves. 
- Week 5: 
  - We will finish working with DE 
  - We will introduce Monocole3 
    - Monocle 3 can help you perform three main types of analysis:
      - Clustering, classifying, and counting cells. Single-cell RNA-Seq experiments allow you to discover new (and possibly rare) subtypes of cells. Monocle 3 helps you identify them.
      - Constructing single-cell trajectories. In development, disease, and throughout life, cells transition from one state to another. Monocle 3 helps you discover these transitions.
      - Differential expression analysis. Characterizing new cell types and states begins with comparisons to other, better understood cells. Monocle 3 includes a sophisticated, but easy-to-use system for differential expression.
- Week 6: 
  - We will wrap up Monocole3 trajectory analysis
  - We will introduce WGCNA
    - Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. 
- Week 7: 
  - We will continue working with WGCNA
- Week 8:
  - We will wrap up with WGCNA
- Week 9/10:
  - Wrap up everything
  - Start finalizing presentation and poster 
  - Practice for presentation
